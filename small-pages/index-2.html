        <p>We can't have Europe now, but a hop across the pond isn’t required to feel like you’re overseas. Whether you're craving the sun-drenched Mediterranean coast, the cozy beer halls of Bavaria, or the alpine beauty of Switzerland, there are plenty of stand-ins closer to home. And while they may not be as good as the real thing, they're guaranteed to satisfy your Euro wanderlust at least for a little bit.
        </p>
        <h1>Want the Amalfi Coast? Try Catalina Island, CA
        </h1>
        <img src="../image/p-2 top-2.jpg">
        <p>Just an hour’s ferry ride from Long Beach, CA, the petit isle of <span>Catalina</span> could’ve been plucked straight from the Mediterranean. Angelenos flock here for a dose of Vitamin Sea, lazy waterfront picnics, and <span>Hotel Metropole’s</span> airy suites overlooking the sea.</p>
        <p>Once owned by gum tycoon William Wrigley Jr., Catalina is now a prized nature preserve and its waters are filled with bat rays, octopus, and horn bass--the best way to explore the island's sealife is on a <span>snorkeling trip</span> or <span>glass bottom boat adventure.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Once you've seen enough water creatures, claim a chaise lounge and a frosty glass of “Buffalo Milk”—the island’s signature cocktail (Kahlua, vodka, Crème de Cocoa, and whipped cream)—at the sceney <span>Descanso Beach Club.</span>
        </p>
        <h1>Dreaming of France? There's Natchitoches, LA
        </h1>
        <img src="../image/p-2 top-3.jpg">
        <p>If you’ve done New Orleans but still crave some French flavor, head to <span>Natchitoches</span>, Louisiana’s oldest city.
        </p>
        <p>The sister city to NOLA is mainly known for its over-the-top <span>Christmas festival</span> but there’s plenty more to do here. Start with a walk through the Natchitoches National Historic Landmark District, 33 blocks of buildings that date back to the late 1700s. The architectural styles range from Classic Queen Anne-style mansions to Art Deco commercial buildings to French Creole homes. Leave enough time to check out the Fort St. Jean Baptiste Historic Site (a full-scale replica of the first permanent European settlement of the Louisiana Purchase) and the town’s original parish church. For the perfect French-Creole meal post sightseeing, make your way to <span>Merci Beaucoup</span>, a family-owned restaurant that dishes up a legendary Cajun baked potato.
        </p>
        <h1>Going Dutch? Head to Holland, MI
        </h1>
        <img src="../image/p-2 top-4.jpg">
        <p>As the site of the only working Dutch windmill in America (a local businessman transplanted it from The Netherlands in 1961), this Western Michigan town is equal parts kitschy and cute. Score a prime room overlooking Lake Michigan at the <span>Beach House at Lake Street</span>, a cluster of white clapboard townhouses with private patios.
        </p>
        <p>Breakfast at nearby <span>DeBoer’s Bakkerij</span> is practically mandatory thanks to the melt-in-your-mouth butter cake—it’s the perfect place to quell your appetite before a walk through <span>Veldheer Gardens</span>, where 5.5 million tulips share real estate with a full-fledged, 10-acre Dutch Village.Also worth exploring: Holland’s burgeoning craft beer and liquor scene, with star players like the <span>New Holland Brewing</span>, known for its crisp lagers and citrusy IPAs.
        </p>
        <h1>Longing for Switzerland? Choose Ouray, CO
        </h1>
        <img src="../image/p-2 top-5.jpg">
        <p>Set 7600-feet high in a box canyon, this <span>Victorian-era mining town</span> is affectionately dubbed the Switzerland of America-- and with good reason. Like the mountainous European country, Ouray is a hiker's paradise.
        </p>
        <p>Two of our favorite climbs: Ouray Ice Park, a series of manmade waterfalls, and Box Canyon Falls, with its incredible black swift colony.
        </p>
        <p>With all the heart-pumping exercise required of you here, you'll need plenty of places to refuel. Go for a hearty meal at <span>The Outlaw</span> steakhouse, then unwind with a deep tissue massage at <span>The Box Canyon</span> Lodge spa overlooking the Rocky Mountains.
        </p>
        <h1>All About Spain? Don't Miss St. Augustine, FL
        </h1>
        <img src="../image/p-2 top-6.jpg">
        <p>Horse-drawn carriages, candle-lit porches, cobblestone streets—this <span>coastal city</span> is the oldest European settlement in the US and has the perfect mix of Spanish swagger and southern hospitality.
        </p>
        <p>Drop your bags off at the <span>44 Spanish Street</span> Inn, a 1920s-era boarding house turned hotel in the city's historic center. Your first stop: <span>Ponce de Leon’s Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park</span> , where you'll learn all about St. Augustine’s origin story. It's rumored Ponce De Leon first landed here and the park's healing waters are said to reverse the aging process (hmm...).
        </p>
        <p>Continue the cultural crash course at <span>Castillo San Marcos</span>, a 315-year-old masonry fort constructed to protect the former Spanish settlement from invaders.
        </p>
        <p>If you'd rather skip the sights and hang out on the beach, there are plenty of sandy stretches to choose from including the unspoiled Crescent Beach and the more popular Vilano Beach.
        </p>
        <h1>Want Germany? Go to Leavenworth, WA
        </h1>
        <img src="../image/p-2 top-7.jpg">
        <p>When the lumber-based economy of this <span>Pacific Northwestern town</span> took a hit in 1960s, it reinvented itself into a German wonderland, with the snowcapped peaks of the Cascade Mountains as its backdrop.
        </p>
        <p>Today, the charming hamlet, about 130 miles east of Seattle, has the largest Oktoberfest celebration outside of Munich and an annual Bavarian Christmas market that rivals any German city's. Hike Icicle Ridge, a switchback trail with eye-popping views of Leavenworth. Or spend a few hours touring the <span>Nutcracker Museum</span>, with more than 7,000 nutcrackers that range from Roman times to modern day. For dinner, <span>Munchen Haus</span> serves stellar beers and brats and an apple cider-simmered sauerkraut you won't want to miss. It's the perfect comfort food to fill your stomach before tumbling into bed at <span>Sleeping Lady Mountain Resort.</span>
        </p>
        <h1>Hoping for Norway? Poulsbo, WA Is It.
        </h1>
        <img src="../image/p-2 top-8.jpg">
        <p>On the Kitsap Peninsula on Puget Sound sits the town of <span>Poulsbo</span>, known as “Little Norway on the Fjord.” A wave of immigrants settled here in the 1880s and the town has kept its ties with Norway ever since.
        </p>
        <p>The Norweigan influence can be felt everywhere, from the Scandinavian-style architecture and standout breweries (<span>Rainy Daze Brewery</span> is a must) to the Viking Festival in May and Midsommer Festival in June.Other can't miss higlights: <span>the Kitsap Memorial State Park</span>, the Arts District--don't miss <span>Front Street Gallery</span> -- and <span>the waterfront park.</span>
        </p>
        <h1>Yearning for Sweden? Consider Lindsborg, KS
        </h1>
        <img src="../image/p-2 top-9.jpg">
        <p>It’s no wonder they call the teeny town of <span>Lindsborg</span> "Little Sweden." Immigrants from the Värmland Province settled in this Smoky Valley village in the late 1800s, earning it a distinctly Scandinavian vibe. Shopkeepers often greet visitors with a jovial “Valkommen” and there are more than 35 fire-engine red Dala horses (extra-large versions of the classic Swedish children’s toy) scattered across Lindsborg’s public spaces.
        </p>
        <p>The town's oldest residence, <span>Stenheuset</span> is a cozy sandstone cabin built in 1877 by a Swedish stonemason that was recently converted into a rental property. If it's booked, check into the area’s more established stay <span>Dröm Sött</span>, an 18-room bed-and-breakfast just off Main Street.
        </p>
        <p>From there, you can easily explore Lindsborg's Neoclassical and German medieval homes with a <span>self-guided walking tour</span>, followed by a mouthwatering sausage sandwich at <span>Öl Stuga</span> —Swedish for “ale cottage.”

        <h1>Fantasizing about Greece? Go to Tarpon Springs, FL
        </h1>
        <img src="../image/p-2 top-10.jpg">
        <p>Who wouldn't want some Greece in their life right now? Set on Florida's Gulf Coast, <span>Tarpon Springs</span> has the highest concentration of Greeks living in any city in the US. Back in the 1900s, deep-sea divers came here in search of sea sponges and today the city is known as the sponge capital of the world.
        </p>
        <p>Spend your afternoon strolling Dodecanese Boulevard (named after Greece’s Dodecanse Islands) lined with Greek bakeries and restaurants (<span>try Hellas</span> for lunch). Or head to one of the many <span>beaches or nature parks</span> in the area for a waterfront picnic.
